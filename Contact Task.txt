The aim of this task is to have an aggregate that represents the state of a person.
A person in this case is called a Contact, they can be linked to different objects in the system.
E.g. a shop or a limited company

The solution is currently configured to use a local instance of eventstore.
You can use the docker image here:
https://hub.docker.com/r/eventstore/eventstore/

Requirements
An endpoint to Create a Contact with an address, phone number and some mechanism to link to other objects.
An endpoint to link the Contact to an object
An endpoint to remove a link from a Contact
The endpoints need to be idempotent
Handle any race coniditions
Return validation and domain errors to the client
Have reusable events and domain logic so we can extend the system
It must be completed in C# .Net Core 3.1+

There are a few TODOs around the solution which are a guide.
If you wish to change the implementation or move away from Eventstore you can.
